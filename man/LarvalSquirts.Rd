\title{Larvae of sea squirts (\emph{Styela plicata})}
\format{data.frame with 165 observations and 10 variables}
\source{
These data were obtained from the Excel spreadsheet that is available on Dryad: \url{http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.574r7}, and are associated with Crean et al. (2011).

LarvalSquirts

\description{
Raw data from the Crean et al. (2011) study on phenotypic selection across the metamorphic boundary in \emph{Styela plicata} larvae.  These data were downloaded from Dryad and then formatted for use in this R package. \code{LarvalSquirts} includes the data for both the high density and low density treatments, and contains the following variables:

\describe{
\item{\code{wr}}{relative fitness based on postmetamorphic survival to reproduction after 4 months in the field (\code{survivalToReprod}) for all larvae.}
\item{\code{ws}}{relative fitness based on postmetamorphic growth, using wet weight (in grams) after 4 months in the field as a proxy (\code{wetWeight4months.g}) for all larvae.}
\item{\code{Wr}}{absolute fitness based on postmetamorphic survival to reproduction after 4 months in the field (\code{survivalToReprod}) for all larvae. 1 = survived, 0 = died.}
\item{\code{Ws}}{absolute fitness based on postmetamorphic growth, using wet weight (in grams) after 4 months in the field as a proxy (\code{wetWeight4months.g}) for all larvae.}
\item{\code{larvalArea.um2}}{area of the larva, "estimated from the average of at least three measurements", in units of squared micrometers.}
\item{\code{hatchTime.mins}}{time to hatching, a premetamorphic trait used as a proxy for development time, in units of minutes.}
\item{\code{settleTime.mins}}{time to settlement, a premetamorphic trait measured every 4 hours, in units of minutes. "Larvae that had not settled within 25 hours posthatch were excluded from their analyses (n = 3)".}
\item{\code{trial}}{one of five replicate runs ("trials") that were run betwen May and October 2009.}
\item{\code{individual}}{individual identification code.}
\item{\code{treatment}}{experimental treatment group (LD = low density, HD = high density).}

\examples{
# Load the data
data(LarvalSquirts)

# Look at the structure of the data.frame
str(LarvalSquirts)

# Run a linear regression with wr as the response and the phenotypic traits as the predictors
lm(wr ~ ., data = LarvalSquirts[,5:7])
